    <h1 class="text" id="about-header">Hello, my name is Hristo </h1>


  <p class="text">I am 22 years old and I was born in Yambol, Bulgaria. I found my passion for software development and programming in my high school years. I started off with C++ , but I veered to JavaScript and Ruby after doing some web development hobby projects.
Currently, I am in my senior year at <a href="http://www.aubg.edu" target="_blank" >American University in Bulgaria </a>, studying Information Systems and Business Administration. </p>
  <p class="text"> Apart from programming, I am into bodybuilding, weightlifting and fitness education. My philosophy is that a healthy body is a requisite for a healthy mind. I love reading about human biology, chemistry, physiology and biohacking. I have won several medals from university-wide weightlifting and arm-wrestling competitions and spent time personally training people with various fitness goals. </p>

  <p class="text">My dream is to start my own tech business. I am looking for ways to combine my passion for programming with my interest in fitness education into something valuable. </p>
